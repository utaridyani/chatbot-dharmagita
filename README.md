## About the Project

This project aims to develop an intelligent chatbot using the RASA framework, 
designed to help users access and retrieve information about Dharmagita, which refers 
to the sacred songs and chants in Hinduism, particularly within the Balinese tradition. 
The chatbot will serve as a virtual assistant, providing users with detailed information, guidance, and resources related to Dharmagita.
